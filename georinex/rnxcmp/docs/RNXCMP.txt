==== What are these programs? ====

There are two basic programs RNX2CRX and CRX2RNX. RNX2CRX is a program to 
compress a RINEX observation file into the Compact RINEX format and 
CRX2RNX is to restore the original RINEX files from the Compact RINEX file.
From the version 4.0.0, these programs are able to handle not only the 
RINEX format version 2.xx (and the corresponding Compact RINEX format 
version 1.0), but also the RINEX format version 3.xx (and the corresponding 
Compact RINEX format version 3.0):

[compression]
RINEX format version 2.xx --> (RNX2CRX) --> Compact RINEX format version 1.0
RINEX format version 3.xx --> (RNX2CRX) --> Compact RINEX format version 3.0

[restoration]
Compact RINEX format version 1.0 --> (CRX2RNX) --> RINEX format version 2.xx
Compact RINEX format version 3.0 --> (CRX2RNX) --> RINEX format version 3.xx

Since Compact RINEX is ASCII text format, the high compression rate is achieved 
by combining the Compact RINEX file generation with an additional standard
data compression program such as UNIX "compress" command.
 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
 * For convenience, frontend tools RNX2CRZ(.bat) and CRZ2CRX(.bat) are also  *  
 * provided to do these two steps by one command. We recommend to use these  *
 * tools for the compression/decompression of all RINEX files (i.e., for     *
 * navigation message files and met files, too): They will automatically     *
 * skip the Compact RINEX step for non-observation files (see below).        *
 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

the developement design of the software RNXCMP.

==== How to install the software? ====

The following is an instruction to install the programs.
1. Compile the source code if needed.(see the next section)
2. Copy (or move) the all binaries and frontend tools to a directory
   which is listed in the command serch paths. To see which 
   directories are listed, type "echo $PATH" for unix or 
   "echo %PATH%" for DOS. Or, you would add new path to those list.
3. (for UNIX) Set permission of the files to be executed.
4. (for DOS) To use DOS frontend tools, put following tools into the 
   directory which is included in the command serch paths.
         1) compress.exe, compr.bat, decompr.bat
            These programs are avairable from, e.g.
               ftp://ftp.unibe.ch/aiub/pcrinex/compress.zip
            compress.exe in the above woeks on 16- or 64-bit system.
            The compress.exe for 64-bit Windows system is available from
               httpd;//www.willus.com/archive/utils.shtml
                     -->   ;//www.willus.com/archive/unixcmds.zip
            or
               http://sourceforge.net/projects/myunxcmd/?source=directory
         2) SPLNAME.EXE (provided with the package, or, if needed, you may
            compile the source code splname.c which is also avairable in
            the source package.


==== How to compile the programs? ====

    If necesary, you may compile the source code of the programs to get
    executable binaries for your system. For the compilation, an ANSI C
    compiler is necessary, or GNU C can also be used with "-ansi" option.

    The followings are examples of commands for compiling
        [using GNU C on Sun OS 5.9, or Linux]
             gcc -ansi -O2 -static rnx2crx.c -o RNX2CRX
             gcc -ansi -O2 -static crx2rnx.c -o CRX2RNX
          # In past, I have observed compiling errors on SunOS4.1.3 even using
          # gcc with the "-ansi" option. This problem was caused by 
          # non-standard behaviour of function "sprintf" that was provided in
          # the library of OS. Support for this irregularity was terminated,

        [using SUN C compiler on Sun OS 5.9]
             cc -xO2 -Bstatic rnx2crx.c -o RNX2CRX
             cc -xO2 -Bstatic crx2rnx.c -o CRX2RNX

        [on HP-UX B.11.00]
             cc -Aa -O -o RNX2CRX rnx2crx.c
             cc -Aa -O -o CRX2RNX crx2rnx.c


==== How to use the programs? ====

  The programs should be put into one of directories in the list 
  of command search paths, or the directory in which the files are 
  put should be added to the list of comand search path.

  The basic usage of the program RNX2CRX is as follows.

         RNX2CRX [file] [-] [-f] [-e # of epochs] [-s] [-h]
          stdin and stdout are used if input file name is not given.
          -       : output to stdout
          -f      : force overwrite of output file
          -e #    : initialize the compression operation at every # epochs
          -s      : warn and skip strange epochs (default: stop with error status)
          -h      : display help message

  The default file name of the CompactRINEX file is "*.??d".
  If the input RINEX file name follows the file name convention of RINEX
  format (*.??o) and option '-' is not specified, then the default file 
  name is chosen for the output file.
  The followings are the example of usage of RNX2CRX for UNIX environment:
    - If a standard naming convention is adoped;
            RNX2CRX rinex.07o
      The name of the output file will be rinex.07d, in this case.

    - If you want output file not to follow the naming convention;
            RNX2CRX rinex.07o - > test.out

    - If the input file name doesn't follow the convention;
            cat  rinex.in | RNX2CRX - > test.out
      "-" may be ommitted in this case since input file name is not given 
      as a command argument and, hence, stdin and stdout is used automatically.

    - If the input RINEX file is compressed one by gzip;
            zcat rinex.in.gz | RNX2CRX > test.out

  The usage of CRX2RNX is similar to RNX2CRX. Type 'CRX2RNX -h' to display 
  the help message.
 

==== Features of the programs ====

  Although the specification of Compact RINEX format allows the differential 
  order for numenrical data up to 9th, CRX2RNX can handle that up to 5th
  at current. It may not be problem as far as RNX2CRX is used for compression
  since the muximum order of differnce taken by RNX2CRX is 3rd at current.

  RNX2CRX checks some anomaries in the input files such as followings.
     - the same satellite appears twice at the same epoch
     - more data types are found than specified in a header line.
     - middle part of the file is collapsed.
  RNX2CRX skips the epoch and tries to find next epoch to continue 
  conversion if option '-s' is specified.

  RNX2CRX has an option '-e [# of epochs]' to initialize the compression 
  periodically. When some part of the Compact RINEX file is lost, the data
  can not be recovered thereafter until all the data arc are initialized 
  for differential operation. This option may be used to increase chances 
  to recover parts of data by using an option of CRX2RNX with cost of 
  increase of file size.

  CRX2RNX has the option '-s' to skip anomarous data like RNX2CRX, but
  it can recover the data after the epoch that the differential operations
  of all data are initialized, because the differntial scheme relies on
  continuity of the data sequence. To use this option, be sure that number
  of data types does not change during the missing part of the data.

  If the differential phase or pseudorange data becomes larger than 1000000.0
  (due to cycle slip, for example), RNX2CRX initializes the arc of the 
  data type.

  If RNX2CRX and CRX2RNX detect a truncation of the file or other strange
  things, the programs stop with an error message.

  The line feed code of the input files can be one of "LF", "CR+LF", or even
  mixture of them. "CR" (that is often the case of Mac OS) is not supported
  at current. Please convert "CR" into "LF" or "CR+LF" before the processing.
  The line feed code of the output file depends on the OS (LF for UNIX,
  CR+LF for DOS/Windows).

  Some old RINEX (version 2.xx) files assign the format (12(A1,I2)) for 
  continuation lines of satellite list instead of (32X,12(A1,I2)). RNX2CRX 
  detects it by judging if the 3rd column of the continuation line is a space 
  or not, and reads and converts it correctly. In this case, the continuation 
  line is corrected to the correct format after uncompressing by CRX2RNX.


==== Front-End Tools ====

  The frontend tools RNX2CRZ and CRZ2RNX can be used together with the
  programs.

     - to allow multiple file processing (wildcard notation can be used)
       RNX2CRZ *.???  (RINEX OBS/NAV/etc., CRINEX, or compressed RINEX OBS)
       CRZ2RNX *.???  (CRINEX, compressed CRINEX or RINEX OBS/NAV/etc.)

     - to directly generate z-compressed files from ASCII RINEX observation
       files(RNX2CRZ):

         RINEX obs   -->    CRINEX    --> z-compressed CRINEX

       ????????.??o  --> ????????.??d -->    ????????.??d.Z   (UNIX)
       ????????.??O  --> ????????.??D -->    ????????.??E     (DOS)
       *.rnx  --> *.crx -->    *.crx.Z   (UNIX/DOS)

     - and vice versa (CRZ2RNX)

     - to generate z-compressed CompactRINEX files from old z-compressed RINEX 
       observation files (RNX2CRZ):

       z-compressed RINEX obs -->    CRINEX    --> z-compressed CRINEX

       ????????.??o.Z         --> ????????.??d -->    ????????.??d.Z   (UNIX)
       ????????.??Y           --> ????????.??D -->    ????????.??E     (DOS)

     - to z-compress CompactRINEX files (RNX2CRZ):

           CRINEX     -->   z-compressed CRINEX

       ????????.??d   -->    ????????.??d.Z                   (UNIX) 
       ????????.??D   -->    ????????.??E                     (DOS)

     - to z-compress RINEX NAV/MET/etc. files (RNX2CRZ):

         RINEX nav   --> z-compressed RINEX nav

       ????????.??n  -->    ????????.??n.Z                    (UNIX)
       ????????.??m  -->    ????????.??m.Z                    (UNIX)
       ????????.??N  -->    ????????.??X                      (DOS)
       ????????.??M  -->    ????????.??W                      (DOS)

     - and vice versa (CRZ2RNX)

     - to decompress old z-compressed RINEX observation files (CRZ2RNX):

       ????????.??o.Z  -->    ????????.??o                    (UNIX)
       ????????.??Y    -->    ????????.??O                    (DOS)

     - to convert CompactRINEX files to RINEX observation files (CRZ2RNX):

       ????????.??d    -->    ????????.??o                    (UNIX)
       ????????.??d.Z  -->    ????????.??o                    (UNIX)
       ????????.??D    -->    ????????.??O                    (DOS)
       ????????.??E    -->    ????????.??O                    (DOS)


Remarks:
  - The extensions of the input files should conform to the RINEX convention
    recommended in the documentation of RINEX ver 3.0:
       Gurtner, W., L. Estey (2006), RINEX The Receiver Independent Exchange
             Format Version 3.01, avairable from 
             ftp://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/data/format/rinex301.pdf
    The extentions of the output files alse follow the RINEX convention.
  - UNIX versino of the front-end tools has following feature (ver. 4.0.4-)
       * help message is shown if executed with option -h or with no argument.
       * The output files are created to the same directory as the 
         input file in default. The option "-c" may be used to change 
         them to the current directory.
       * The input files are removed if option "-d" is specified,
         otherwise they are preserved.
       * The tools inquire if overwrite the an output file if it preexist.
         The option -f forces overwriting without inquiring
       * Both Z-compressed and gzipped files can be processed.
