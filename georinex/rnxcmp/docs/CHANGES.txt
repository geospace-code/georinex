Change history of the RNXCMP software

 2016-04-14
   - Version 4.0.7 released.
   - Licence policy is changed to apply Geospatial Information 
     Authority of Japan Website Terms of Use. Read Licence.txt.

 2015-02-19
   - The values of the following constants are increased:
        MAXSAT        90     -> 100
        MAXTYPE       50     -> 100
        MAXCLM        1024   -> 2048
        MAX_BUFF_SIZE 131072 -> 204800

 2014-03-24
   - Version 4.0.6 released.
   - Fixing a bug in crx2rnx.c. in outputting epoch lines in case there 
     are skipped epochs when a corrupted Compact RINEX ver. 3 files 
     are processed with the option "-s".      
   - check and stop with an error if value of data exceed the range 
     allowd in RINEX format (crx2rnx.c).
   - Manipulation of file names in the new file naming convention
     (*.rnx/crx) is added, except for front-end tools for DOS. 

 2012-07-18
   - Version 4.0.5 released.
   - Fixing a bug in rnx2crx.c. A variable "dummy" is initialized.
   - Fixing a bug in displaying error message(#16)
   - Checking length of input file name
   - Minor changes to suppress warning messages at compilation.

 2009-09-08
   - Due to a bug in the front-end tool RNX2CRZ, output file name 
     for *.yy[Oo] files were in correct. RNX2CRZ is just replaced 
     to the bug-fixed one without updating version ID.
     Thanks to Huib de Ligt for notice and suggestion.

 2009-07-07
   - Version 4.0.4 released.
   - The function "getline" is renamed "ggetline" to avoid confliction 
      with that referenced in stdio in gcc 4.4. (rnx2crx.c)
   - A truncatad CRINEX file can have no LF character in the last line.
     former versions of CRX2RNX crash with core dumping in such cases.
     This problem is solved by checking null pointer in the macro
     CHOP_LF to skip when LF is not found. (crx2rnx.c)
     Thank to Jelemy Palmer for notice and suggestion.
   - MAXTYPE is increased from 30 to 50 (crx2rnx.c)
   - correction of typos in error messages.
   - UNIX front-end tools RNX2CRZ and CRZ2RNX were extensively
     modified. Resolution of te following ambiguities/bugs in the 
     previous vresions are major changes:
        * setting of output directory (default: the same directory
          as that of the input file)
        * case of deletion of input files (default: preserve)
        * case of overwriting an output file (default: inquiring) 
     Options to control them are added.
     Users should be careful about it, since, in some cases, the 
     behavior of the new tools can be different from that of 
     the old ones concernning for these aspects. 
   - The UNIX and DOS front-end tools can handle more RINEX file types.
   - Documentations of the Compact RINEX format (crinex1.0.txt and
     crinex3.0.txt) are removed from the distribution packages.
     The following paper is now avairable for the details of the compression
     format and the developement design of the software:
      Hatanaka, Y. (2008), A Compression Format and Tools for GNSS Observation
          Data, Bulletin of the Geospatioal Information Authority of Japan, 55,

2007-06-21
  - Version 4.0.3 released by fixing a bug.
  - It was found that crx2rnx.c version 4.0.0-4.0.2 contains 
    a serious bug which may output incorrect or corrupted data 
    due to lack of a procedure to prevent overflow of lower digits
    of data (or its difference) in middle of the recovering operation.
    The overflow does not happen at the begining of data arcs, but
    probability of it increases as many epochs are processed for 
    a data arc without initialization. Therefore, The higher the 
    sampling rate is, the easier the overflow happens.
  - Rnx2crx.c is free from the above bug, but the version of it was 
    also updated to become the same as crx2rnx.c.

2007-06-10
  Following changes were made on the front-end tools
  (suggested by Mike Craymer of Natural Resources Canada)
  - "compress" command appears in the tool CRZ2RNX was an
    error and corrected to "uncompress".
  - modified to accept upper case in the extention of file names.

2007-06-08
  - Version 4.0.2 released.
  - Incompatibility between arguments and format strings of sscanf 
    or sprintf was fixed. This bug was contained in rnx2crx.c 
    and crx2rnx.c of version 4.0.0 and 4.0.1, and may disturb
    output files if the programs are compiled with 16-bit compilers.
  - A string "ver." was eliminated from the display of the program
    version in the help messages.

2007-06-06
  - Version 4.0.1 released.
  - Supports for VMS and SUN OS 4.1.x was terminated.
  - In the previous versions, the default output file was created
    in the "current" directory whatever directory the input file
    was in. From this version, the output file was created in the
    same directory as the input file that was specified in the
    command argument.
  - The above two modifications made it possible to eliminate 
    system-dependency of the source codes. The adjustment of
    the source codes before compilation to switch OS environment
    (UNIX/DOS) became unnecessary.

2007-02-05
  - Version 4.0.0 created. (It is a test version.)
  - Capability of conversion from RINEX version 3.00 to Compact
    RINEX format version 3.0 (RNX2CRX), and vice versa (CRX2RNX),
    was implemented. Conversion between RINEX version 2.xx
    and Compact RINEX format version 1.0 is also possible as before.
